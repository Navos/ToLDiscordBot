This is a discord bot that is meant to be used for the game Throne of Lies.

It will allow users from a certain role to direct message the bot to queue and an admin user to send out the ToL invite code to the first 15 people within the queue.

The following commands exist right now:

!queue -> Will queue you for a game. Need to have the queue role.
!invite <code> -> Will send out codes to the first 15 people in the queue. This will dequeue them. Need to have the invite role.
!count -> Get the current count of users in the queue. Need to have the invite role.
!clear -> Clear the current queue. Need to have the invite role.

The config.json contains three necessary pieces of information:

1) The discord bot token
2) The discord role for the person that can send out the invite codes and modify the queue.
3) The discord role for the person that can queue for games
